# Fix Tab Size

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that fixes tab size according to the settings.

As reported on the [forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/customizing-universal-tab-size/7998/2):

Obsidian has setting for tab size:

But Obsidian partially ignores this setting and always inserts 4 spaces when you press `Tab` button in the editor, if you have setting `Indent using tabs` disabled.

This plugin fixes the editor tab size making it to match `Indent visual width` setting.
